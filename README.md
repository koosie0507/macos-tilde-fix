# Mac OS X Tilde Keyboard Mapper

With some Apple keyboards the `~` key is located right to the left shift key. The EN US layout, however, places the `~` key near the top left corner.
The aim of this project is to move the `~` key near the top-left corner or the keyboard (left of the numeric 1 key).

This works only for Apple keyboards, only on Mac OSX.
